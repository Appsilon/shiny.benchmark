How to install?
---------------

```r
remotes::install_github("Appsilon/shiny.benchmark")
```

Dependencies
------------

`shiny.benchmark` can use two different engines to test the change in the performance of your application: [shinytest2](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest2/) and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
The latter requires `Node` (version 12 or higher) and `yarn` (version 1.22.17 or higher) to be available.
To install them on your computer, follow the guidelines on the documentation pages:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

Besides that, on Linux, it might be required to install other `Cypress` dependencies.
Check the [documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Linux-Prerequisites) to find out more.
